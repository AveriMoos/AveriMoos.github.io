        <img src="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1510800/monarch-butterfly-butterlfy-weed-flower.jpg"
            style="width:400px;" />
        <!--alternate text-->
        <p>Butterflies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect">insects</a> in the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolepidoptera">macrolepidopteran</a> clade Rhopalocera from the
            order
            Lepidoptera, which also
            includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth">moths</a>. Adult butterflies have large, often
            brightly
            coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight.
            The group comprises the large superfamily <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilionoidea">Papilionoidea</a>, which contains at least one former
            group, the skippers
            (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea"), and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the
            moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea"). Butterfly fossils date to the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene">Paleocene</a>, about 56
            million years ago..</p>

        <p>Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which
            their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva">larvae</a>, known as <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>, will feed. The caterpillars grow,
            sometimes very rapidly, and when fulttps://en.wikily
            developed, <a href="hpedia.org/wiki/Pupa">pupate</a> in a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa#Chrysalis">chrysalis</a>. When <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> is complete, the pupal skin splits,
            the
            adult insect climbs
            out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics,
            have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may
            take
            several years to pass through their entire life cycle.</p>

        <p>Butterflies are often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)">polymorphic</a>, and
            many
            species make use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage">camouflage</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry">mimicry</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism">aposematism</a> to evade
            their predators. Some, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly">monarch</a> and
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_cardui">painted lady, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_migration">migrate</a> over long distances. Many
                butterflies
                are</a>
            attacked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism">parasites</a> or <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid">parasitoids</a>, including <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid_wasp">wasps</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa">protozoans</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly">flies</a>, and other invertebrates, or are preyed
            upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic
            crops or
            trees; other species are agents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollination">pollination</a> of
            some
            plants. Larvae of a few butterflies
            (e.g.,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletinae">harvesters</a>)
            eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant">ants</a>, while
            others live as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)">mutualists</a> in association
            with
            ants.
            Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.</p>

        <h3 id="Taxonomy and Phylogeny" /h3>
            <h3>Taxonomy and Phylogeny</h3>
            <P>The earliest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> fossils are of a small
                moth, <a href="">Archaeolepis mane</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic">Jurassic</a>
                age, around
                190 million
                years ago (mya). Butterflies evolved from moths, so while the butterflies are <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly">monophyletic</a> (forming a
                single clade), the moths are not. The oldest butterflies are from the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene">Palaeocene</a> <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoClay">MoClay</a> or <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_Formation">Fur Formation</a> of
                Denmark, approximately 55 million years old. The oldest American butterfly is the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Late Eocene</a> <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodryas">Prodryas
                    persephone</a> from the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florissant_Fossil_Beds_National_Monument">Florissant Fossil
                    Beds</a>, approximately 34 million years old.

                Traditionally, butterflies have been divided into the superfamily Papilionoidea excluding the smaller
                groups of
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipper_(butterfly)">Hesperiidae</a> (skippers) and the more
                moth-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedylidae">Hedylidae</a> of America. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">Phylogenetic</a> analysis suggests that the
                traditional Papilionoidea is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with
                respect to
                the other two groups, so they should both be included
                within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade Rhopalocera.

            <h3>Butterfly Biology</h3>
            <h4>General Description</h4>
            <p>Butterfly adults are characterized by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their
                name
                (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their
                colour: they
                are pigmented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin">melanins</a> that give them blacks
                and
                browns, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid">uric acid</a> derivatives and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavones">flavones</a> that
                give them yellows, but many of the blues, greens, reds and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence">iridescent colours</a> are created by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration">structural
                    coloration</a> produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.</p>
            <p>As in all insects, the body is divided into three sections: the head, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax_(insect_anatomy)">thorax</a>, and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen#Other_animals">abdomen</a>. The thorax is composed
                of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed,
                unlike
                those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for
                sipping
                nectar from flowers.</p>
            <p>Nearly all butterflies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_cycle">diurnal</a>, have
                relatively
                bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their
                bodies when at rest, unlike the majority of moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured
                (well
                camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or
                fold them
                closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird_hawk-moth">hummingbird hawk-moth</a>, are
                exceptions to
                these rules.</p>
            <img src="https://extension.umaine.edu/signs-of-the-seasons/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/09/monarchs.jpg"
                style="width:250px;" />

            <p>Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, have a hard (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotin">sclerotised</a>)
                head with strong mandibles used for cutting
                their food, most often leaves. They have cylindrical bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally
                with
                short
                prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each.
                Many are
                well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic
                chemicals
                obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a
                cocoon.

                Many butterflies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>.
                Most
                butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the
                heterogametic sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).</p>

            <h3 id="Distribution and Migration" /h3></h3>
            <h3>Distribution and Migration</h3>
            <P>Butterflies are distributed worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775
                are
                Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 are distributed across the
                combined
                Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly">monarch butterfly</a> is native to the
                Americas, but
                in the
                nineteenth century or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other
                parts
                of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by
                the wind
                or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host
                plants in
                their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.</p>

            <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.conservewildlifenj.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MonarchMap-NatureServe-10_20.png"
                style="width:300px;" />

            <p>Many butterflies, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_cardui">painted lady</a>,
                monarch,
                and several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danainae">danaine</a> migrate for long distances.
                These
                migrations take place over a number of generations and no single individual completes the whole trip.
                The
                eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_Butterfly_Biosphere_Reserve">overwintering sites in
                    Mexico</a>. There is a reverse migration in the spring. It has recently been shown that the
                British
                painted
                lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from
                tropical
                Africa to the Arctic Circle — almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by
                monarch.
                Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon">monsoon</a>
                are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have
                been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_isotope_biogeochemistry">stable hydrogen
                    isotopes</a>.

                Butterflies navigate using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see polarized light and therefore
                orient
                even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum appears to be particularly
                important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are
                short. The
                life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.</p>

            <h3 id="Life Cycle" /h3></h3>
            <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
            <p>Butterflies in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the species. Many
                species
                have long larval life stages while others can remain <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapause">dormant</a> in their pupal or egg stages and thereby
                survive
                winters. The Melissa Arctic (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeneis_melissa">Oeneis
                    melissa</a>)
                overwinters twice as a caterpillar. Butterflies may have
                one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical
                regions with
                tropical regions showing a trend towards <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltinism">multivoltinism</a>.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship">Courtship</a> is often aerial and often involves <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone">pheromones</a>. Butterflies then land on the ground
                or on a
                perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple
                photoreceptor
                cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatophore">spermatophore</a>
                to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as
                the
                Apollos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parnassius">Parnassius</a> plugs her genital opening to
                prevent
                her from mating again.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis)
                and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imago">imago</a> (adult). In the genera <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colias">Colias</a>, <a

                Parnassius, a small number of species are known that
                reproduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis">semi-parthenogenetically</a>; when the
                female
                dies, a partially developed larva emerges
                from her abdomen.</p>
            <img src="https://www.pestwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_334313375.jpg?x14616"
                style="width:300px;" />

            <h4>Egg</h4>
            <p>Butterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined
                with a thin
                coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop.
                Each egg
                contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; the purpose of these
                holes is to
                allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between
                species, but
                are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females
                produce
                between one hundred and two hundred eggs.</p>

            <p>Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts,
                deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a
                meniscus.
                The nature of the glue has been little researched but in the case of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_brassicae">Pieris brassicae</a>, it begins as a pale
                yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to
                air,
                becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathymus">Agathymus</a> do
                not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.</p>
            <p>The egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, especially in
                temperate
                regions, go through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapause">diapause</a> (resting) stage, and
                the
                hatching may take place only in spring. Some
                temperate region butterflies, such as the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphalis_antiopa">Camberwell
                    beauty</a>, lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in
                the summer.</p>

            <h4>Caterpillar</h4>
            <p>Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching
                for and
                eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predators</a>: <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalgis_epius">Spalgis epius</a> eats scale
                insects, while lycaenids such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liphyra_brassolis">Liphyra
                    brassolis</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecophily">myrmecophilous</a>, eating
                ant
                larvae.</p>
            <p>Some larvae, especially those of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaenidae">Lycaenidae</a>,
                form
                mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the
                ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical
                signals. The
                ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(secretion)">honeydew secretions</a>. Large blue
                (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmica">Myrmica ants</a>
                into
                taking them back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony">ant colony</a> where they
                feed on the
                ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.</p>
            <p>Caterpillars mature through a series of developmental stages known as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instar">instars</a>. Near the end of each stage, the
                larva undergoes a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolysis">apolysis</a>, mediated
                by the
                release of a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurohormone">neurohormones</a>. During
                this
                phase, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuticle">cuticle</a>, a tough outer layer made of a
                mixture of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin">chitin</a> and specialized <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein">proteins</a>, is released from
                the softer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium">epidermis</a> beneath, and the epidermis
                begins to
                form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the
                larva <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecdysis">moults</a>, the old cuticle splits and the new
                cuticle
                expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment.
                Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.</p>
            <p>Caterpillars have short antennae and several simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with
                powerful
                mandibles and a pair of maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx
                which
                houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Caterpillars such as those in the genus <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpodes">Calpodes</a>
                (family Hesperiidae) have a specialized tracheal system on the 8th segment that function as a primitive
                lung. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six
                pairs of
                prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleg">prolegs</a>
                have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are
                engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seta">setae</a>, the
                position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration in the form of
                hairs,
                wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is
                taken up by
                the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic
                substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad">gonads</a> start development in the egg
                stage.</p>

                style="width:250px;" />

            <h4>Pupa</h4>
            <p>When the larva is fully grown, hormones such as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothoracicotropic_hormone">prothoracicotropic hormone</a>
                (PTTH) are
                produced. At this point the
                larva stops feeding, and begins "wandering" in the quest for a suitable pupation site, often the
                underside of a
                leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body to
                the
                surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa#Cocoon">cocoon</a> to protect the pupa, most species do
                not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad
                at the
                posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up
                position. Most
                of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is
                rebuilt
                into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings
                folded
                flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between
                them.</p>

            <p>The pupal transformation into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To
                transform
                from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the
                pupal
                wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed
                early on,
                the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes
                compressed from
                top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded
                to its
                full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the
                expression of
                particular transcription factors in the early pupa.</p>

            <img src="https://www.proactivepestmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/butterflychrysalis.jpg"
                style="width:250px;" />

            <h4>Adult Butterfly</h4>
            <p>The reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and
                moths is
                covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and
                dominated
                by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but cannot
                view
                distant objects clearly. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range.
                The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(biology)">antennae</a> are composed of many segments and
                have
                clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery
                antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are
                located
                on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are adapted to sucking and the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible">mandibles</a> are usually reduced in
                size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis">proboscis</a> which is curled up at rest and
                expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs.
                Some
                species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.</p>

            <p>Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliconius">Heliconius butterflies</a> also use their
                proboscis to
                feed on pollen; in these species only 20% of the
                amino acids used in reproduction come from larval feeding, which allow them to develop more quickly as
                caterpillars, and gives them a longer lifespan of several months as adults.</p>

            <p>The thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs
                (among
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphalidae">nymphalids</a>, the first pair is reduced and the
                insects
                walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the
                thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the
                hindwings
                are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked
                together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The
                front two
                segments have a pair of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiracle_(arthropods)">spiracles</a>
                which are
                used in respiration.</p>

            <p>The abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments
                have
                spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has a pair of clasping organs
                attached
                to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the
                female's
                vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a
                seminal
                receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various
                spines,
                teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another
                species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded.
                A newly
                emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolymph">hemolymph</a> and letting them dry, during which
                time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.</p>

            <h3 id="Behaviour" /h3></h3>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>Butterflies feed primarily on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar">nectar</a> from flowers.
                Some also
                derive nourishment from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen">pollen</a>, tree sap,
                rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are
                important as
                pollinators for some species of plants. In general, they do not carry as much pollen load as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee">bees</a>, but they are
                capable of moving pollen over greater distances. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_constancy">Flower constancy</a> has been observed for at
                least
                one species
                of butterfly.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hggby_4gNqY/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:350px;" />
            <p>Adult butterflies consume only liquids, ingested through the proboscis. They sip water from damp patches
                for
                hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, from which they obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and
                other
                minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by
                nectar
                and are attracted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium">sodium</a> in salt; they sometimes
                land on
                people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some
                butterflies also visit dung and scavenge rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In
                many
                species, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud-puddling">mud-puddling</a> behaviour is
                restricted to
                the males, and studies have suggested that the nutrients
                collected may be provided as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuptial_gift">nuptial gift</a>,
                along with
                the spermatophore, during mating.</p>
            <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill-topping_(biology)">hilltopping</a>, males of some species
                seek
                hilltops and ridge tops, which they patrol in search for females.
                Since it usually occurs in species with low population density, it is assumed these landscape points are
                used as
                meeting places to find mates.</p>
            <p>Butterflies use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents. The antennae come in various shapes
                and
                colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show
                knobbed
                antennae. The antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensillum">sensillae</a>. A butterfly's sense of taste
                is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod_leg#Insects">tarsi</a>,
                or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine
                whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.
                Many
                butterflies use chemical signals, pheromones; some have specialized scent scales (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_morphology_of_Lepidoptera#Androconia">androconia</a>)
                or other
                structures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremata">coremata</a> or "hair pencils" in the
                Danaidae). Vision is well developed in butterflies and most
                species are sensitive to the ultraviolet spectrum. Many species show sexual dimorphism in the patterns
                of UV
                reflective patches. Colour vision may be widespread but has been demonstrated in only a few
                species.
                Some butterflies have organs of hearing and some species make <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridulation">stridulatory</a> and clicking sounds.</p>
            <p>Many species of butterfly maintain territories and actively chase other species or individuals that may
                stray
                into them. Some species will bask or perch on chosen perches. The flight styles of butterflies are often
                characteristic and some species have courtship flight displays. Butterflies can only fly when their
                temperature
                is above 27 °C (81 °F); when it is cool, they can position themselves to expose the underside of the
                wings to
                the sunlight to heat themselves up. If their body temperature reaches 40 °C (104 °F), they can orientate
                themselves with the folded wings edgewise to the sun. Basking is an activity which is more common in
                the
                cooler hours of the morning. Some species have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and
                this is
                especially evident in alpine forms.</p>

            <p>As in many other insects, the lift generated by butterflies is more than can be accounted for by

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <h4>Parasitoids, predators, and pathogens</h4>
            <p>Butterflies are threatened in their early stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases
                and
                environmental factors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braconidae">Braconid</a> and other
                parasitic wasps
                lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the
                wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk.
                Most wasps
                are very specific about their host species and some have been used as biological controls of pest
                butterflies
                like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_brassicae">large white butterfly</a>. When
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_rapae">small cabbage white</a> was accidentally
                introduced to New
                Zealand, it
                had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp
                were
                imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of
                caterpillars
                and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the
                parasitoid
                wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.</p>
            <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/18/11/2C75974700000578-3239799-image-a-2_1442572735662.jpg"
                style="width:300px;" />
            <p>Caterpillars are also affected by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a small
                percentage of
                the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a> has been used
                in
                sprays
                to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the <a

                style="width:300px;" />
            <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Alexandra%27s_birdwing">Queen
                    Alexandra's birdwing</a> is
                the largest butterfly in the world. The species is endangered, and is one of only
                three (3) insects (the other two being butterflies as well) to be listed on Appendix I of CITES, making
                international trade illegal. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocybadistes_knightorum">Black
                    grass-dart butterfly</a>
                (Ocybadistes
                knightorum) is a butterfly of the family Hesperiidae. It is endemic to
                New South Wales. It has a very limited distribution in the Boambee area.</p>
            <h4>Defenses</h4>
            <p>Butterflies protect themselves from predators by a variety of means.</p>
            <p>Chemical defences are widespread and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In many cases the
                plants
                themselves evolved these toxic substances as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_defense_against_herbivory">protection</a> against
                herbivores.
                Butterflies have evolved mechanisms
                to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence. These defence mechanisms
                are
                effective only if they are well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in
                unpalatable
                butterflies (aposematism). This signal is commonly mimicked by other butterflies, usually only females.
                A
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry">Batesian mimic</a> imitates another species to
                enjoy
                the protection of that species' aposematism. The <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilio_polytes">common
                    Mormon</a> of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachliopta_aristolochiae">common rose</a> and the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachliopta_hector">crimson rose</a>. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Müllerian_mimicry">Müllerian mimicry</a> occurs when aposematic
                species
                evolve to resemble each other, presumably to
                reduce predator sampling rates; Heliconius butterflies from the Americas are a good example.</p>
            <p>Camouflage is found in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf butterfly and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doleschallia_bisaltide">autumn leaf</a> are remarkable
                imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks
                or
                branches. Others have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimatic_behaviour">deimatic
                    behaviours</a>, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked
                with eyespots as if they were snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilio_cresphontes">Papilio
                    cresphontes</a>() resemble bird droppings so as to be passed over by predators. Some
                caterpillars have hairs and
                bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations.
                Some
                species are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecophily">myrmecophiles</a>, forming <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis">mutualistic associations</a> with ants and gaining
                their protection.
                Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being
                conspicuous. Some
                female <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphalidae">Nymphalid butterflies</a> guard their eggs
                from parasitoidal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp">wasps</a>.</p>
            <img src="https://australianbutterflies.com/ab-content/uploads/2016/04/camouflage-2.jpg"
                style="width:270px;" />
            <p>The Lycaenidae have a false head consisting of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect
                attack from the more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to
                approach from the wrong end, enabling the butterflies to detect attacks promptly. Many
                butterflies have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyespot_(mimicry)">eyespots</a> on the wings;
                these too may deflect attacks, or may serve to attract mates.</p>
            <p>Auditory defences can also be used, which in the case of the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzled_skipper">grizzled skipper</a> refers to vibrations
                generated by the butterfly upon expanding its wings in an attempt to communicate with ant predators.</p>
            <p>Many tropical butterflies have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenism#Seasonal">seasonal
                    forms</a> for dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the
                hormone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecdysone">ecdysone</a>. The dry-season forms are
                usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage
                when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms may help to absorb solar radiation.</p>
            <p>Butterflies without defences such as toxins or mimicry protect themselves through a flight that is more
                bumpy and unpredictable than in other species. It is assumed this behavior makes it more difficult for
                predators to catch them, and is caused by the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence">turbulence</a> created by the small whirlpools
                formed by the
                wings during flight.</p>

            <h4>In mythology and folklore</h4>
            <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn">Lafcadio Hearn</a>, a butterfly was
                seen in Japan as the personification of a person's soul;
                whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly
                enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to
                see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When <a

                were frightened—thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopédie">Diderot's Encyclopédie</a> cites butterflies as a
                symbol for the soul. A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly
                exiting the mouth of a dead man, representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the
                mouth. In line with this, the ancient Greek word for "butterfly" is ψυχή (psȳchē), which primarily
                means "soul" or "mind". According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade">Mircea
                    Eliade</a>, some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_people">Nagas</a> of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur">Manipur</a> claim ancestry
                from a butterfly. In some cultures, butterflies symbolise <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation">rebirth</a>. The butterfly is a symbol
                of being transgender, because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult. In the
                English county of Devon, people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year, to avoid a year of
                bad luck. In the Philippines, a lingering black butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean a
                death in the family. Several American states have chosen an <a

            <h4>Collecting, recording, and rearing</h4>
            <p>Collecting butterflies was once a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography,
                recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_Frohawk">Frederick
                    William Frohawk</a> succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, at a rate of
                four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio
                sized
                handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.</p>
            <h4>In technology</h4>
            <p>Study of the structural coloration of the wing scales of swallowtail butterflies has led to the
                development of more efficient <a

                inspiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> research to
                produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and the development of new display technologies.</p>
